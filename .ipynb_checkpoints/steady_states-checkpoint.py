    """
    Search for unique steady states of an n-dimensional dynamical system
    by sampling random initial conditions and solving f(X) = 0.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    system_func : callable
        A function that takes a list or array of variables [x1, x2, ..., xn]
        and returns the list of derivatives [dx1/dt, dx2/dt, ..., dxn/dt].

    num_vars : int
        The number of variables (dimensions) in the system.

    num_samples : int, optional
        Number of random initial guesses to try. Default is 500.

    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for distinguishing unique solutions. Default is 1e-8.

    domain : list of tuple(float, float), optional
        Bounds for each variable as [(min1, max1), (min2, max2), ...].
        If not provided, defaults to [(0, 1)] for all variables.

    Returns:
    --------
    roots : list of np.ndarray
        A list of unique steady-state vectors [x1_ss, ..., xn_ss]
        that satisfy the condition f(X) â‰ˆ 0 within the specified domain.
